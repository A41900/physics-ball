# 🟡 Physics Ball – JavaScript Movement Demo

A small experimental project built with **vanilla JavaScript** to explore
movement, gravity, input handling, and game feel.

This project focuses on **clean state management and responsive controls** rather
than visual complexity.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this mini-project was to:
- Understand how keyboard input translates into motion
- Separate **input**, **logic**, and **rendering**
- Experiment with gravity, jumping, momentum, and responsiveness
- Practice debugging behavior-based issues (not just syntax errors)

---

## 🕹️ Controls

- **← / →** — Move horizontally  
- **↑** — Jump (single press)

---

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- `requestAnimationFrame` game loop
- State-driven player movement (`position`, `velocity`)
- Event-based jump handling (prevents repeated jumping)
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- Physics-inspired tuning for a “light” feel

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML5
- CSS3

---

## 📌 Notes

This project was developed iteratively, with multiple refinements focused on
movement feel and responsiveness.  
It serves as a **learning and experimentation project**, not a finished game.

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- Add platforms and collisions
- Camera movement
- Visual feedback (squash/stretch)
- Multiple levels

Developed independently as part of my learning journey in JavaScript and front-end development.
