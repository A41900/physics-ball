🌸 Physics Ball – Movement & Physics Experiment (Vanilla JS)

This project started because I wanted a project on GitHub and I enjoy making
games. I'm also interested in physics, so I decided to experiment with movement
instead of building a full game.

🌸 Purpose
The goal of this project is to explore player movement, gravity, and input
handling using only vanilla JavaScript.
Rather than focusing on visuals or polish, I wanted to understand how movement
actually works and how small changes affect game feel.

🌸 What I've learned so far
- Finding the “right” movement depends a lot on position updates and timing
- Using delta time is essential — movement felt completely different when
  testing on another machine
- Starting with one large script made the code hard to reason about
- Gradually splitting logic into smaller modules made the project easier to
  maintain and understand
- Keeping the architecture modular from the beginning helps avoid refactors later

🌸 Current challenges
This project is still in progress.
So far, the hardest part has been tuning movement to feel right while keeping
the code simple. I expect more challenges as I continue developing it.

🌸 Notes
This is an ongoing learning project and not a finished game.
The code prioritizes clarity and experimentation over optimization.
Built alone as a personal learning project.
